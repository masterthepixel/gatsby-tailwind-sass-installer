  Gatsby's hello-world starter with tailwind and sass preprocessor
</h1>

This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files, sass and tailwind to get a ready to go website with React and tailwind.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  ** Installation **
    clone the git repo:
  ```shell
    # clones repo
    git clone https://github.com/mrDevIll/gatsby-tailwind-sass-installer.git 
    cd gatsby-tailwind-sass-installer
    ```

   ```shell
    # installs gatsby and tailwind and sass dependencies 
    npm install
    ```
    # or use yarn

  ```shell
    # installs gatsby and tailwind and sass dependencies 
    yarn install
    ```
1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-tailwind-sass-installer/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê Usage
  
     In  """ css/style.scss """ you can add your sass customer code while """ css/tailwind.css """ imports tailwind in your project.
     If you wish to import your sass files please add them to """ gatsby-browser.js """.

     You can use """ tailwind.config.js """ to modify tailwind configuration.

     I added a layout component with a header, footer and layout.
